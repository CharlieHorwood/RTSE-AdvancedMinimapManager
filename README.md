# RTSE-AdvancedMinimapManager
An RTSE minimap module designed to give better performance by removing the camera and improving systems, some systems not yet hooked up

This module started off being a standalone however a requirement came up that meant I needed to modify the built in minimap system to work the same way as the module, I have since created an advanced version of the built in module that offers the controls and settings of my module, below I will list what has been changed and added to the built in system.

///// Modifications to Core Minimap
